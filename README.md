    - [DONE] Get your current lame, normi portfolio working in a docker container in your VPS
    - [DONE] Update the copyright year of your OLD PORTFOLIO
    - Add a Favicon to your OLD PORTFOLIO

  - Write Shallow Rendering Tests for each page (ENZYME!)
  - DOCKER IT UP BABY! Deploy the current with page and get a CI/CD Process going! Run Tests tooooo!

  - Deply the site (CI/CD)?
