## Todo
  - Before you really start hacking with react+typescript setup the CI/CD process
    - [DONE] Get your current lame, normi portfolio working in a docker container in your VPS
    - [DONE] Update the copyright year of your OLD PORTFOLIO
    - [WORKING ON IT] Add a Favicon to your OLD PORTFOLIO

  - Write Shallow Rendering Tests for each page (ENZYME!)
  - DOCKER IT UP BABY! Deploy the current with page and get a CI/CD Process going! Run Tests tooooo!

  - Deply the site (CI/CD)?

  - Start making the 3 pages PRETTY!

  - Work Page (I'm Working OVA HERE!!!) (dummy page for now)
  - Rest Page (I'm SLEEPING OVA HERE!!!) (dummy page for now)
  - Play Page (Tiles, and put in your Java Applets, C++ Games, And Other Stuff!!!)
